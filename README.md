World Happiness Report
https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness/version/2
Scientific study of how happy people people are in various countries based on nationwide surveys. These surveys are based on how "happy citizens percieve themselves to be." This report also looks into the governmental and economic circumstances that could lead to these happiness levels.

## Data come alive
The statistics per country will be displayed in a global map. Examining a country will provide statistics about its happiness ranking, as well as the other listed traits that the World Happiness Report felt might contribute to that. The map will be colored based on happiness. A chart may also appear with a list of these statistics.
